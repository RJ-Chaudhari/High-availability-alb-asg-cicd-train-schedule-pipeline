# Train Schedule Application – High Availability CI/CD Architecture

This project demonstrates a production-style High Availability deployment architecture on AWS using:

- Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
- Launch Templates
- Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline
- Docker-based container deployment

The system supports rolling, zero-downtime deployments across multiple Availability Zones.

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline Flow

Developer Push
↓
GitHub
↓  (Webhook)
Jenkins Pipeline
↓
Docker Build (v${BUILD_NUMBER})
↓
Push to DockerHub
↓
Create New Launch Template Version
↓
Trigger ASG Instance Refresh
↓
Rolling Deployment (Multi-AZ)
↓
ALB Routes Traffic to Healthy Instances


Deployment is fully automated. No manual SSH or container restarts are required.

## 🐳 Application Stack

- Node.js application
- Docker containerized
- Exposed on port 80 via container runtime
- Deployed using EC2 user-data script

---

## 🔁 Deployment Strategy

Each code push triggers:

1. Docker image build with version tag `v${BUILD_NUMBER}`
2. Image pushed to DockerHub
3. New Launch Template version created
4. Auto Scaling Group instance refresh started
5. New instances launched with updated image
6. ALB routes traffic only after health checks pass

This ensures:

- Immutable deployments
- Zero downtime
- High availability across AZs

---

## 🏗 Infrastructure Design

- Internet-facing Application Load Balancer
- Target Group with HTTP health checks
- Auto Scaling Group (Min: 2, Multi-AZ)
- Launch Template with versioned user-data
- Security Group referencing (least-privilege model)
- Jenkins server with IAM role for AWS API access

Detailed infrastructure documentation is available in:

infra/architecture.md

infra/security-groups.md

infra/asg-config.md


---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- Application instances are not publicly exposed
- ALB is the only public entry point
- Security groups use reference-based rules
- IAM role attached to Jenkins for controlled AWS operations

---

## 🎯 Key Engineering Principles Demonstrated

- High Availability (Multi-AZ)
- Immutable infrastructure
- Rolling deployments using ASG Instance Refresh
- Health-based traffic routing via ALB
- Fully automated CI/CD using Jenkins + GitHub Webhook
- Version-controlled Docker image strategy

## 📖 Purpose

This repository is part of a hands-on DevOps learning journey focused on building production-aligned infrastructure patterns on AWS.

It demonstrates how CI/CD integrates with infrastructure to enable reliable, repeatable, and zero-downtime deployments.
